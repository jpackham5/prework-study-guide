# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This Prework Study Guide Webpage was created as a resource for boot camp students who were going throught the prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript. I was motivated by wanting to create a foundational knowledge of these important topics before the actual boot camp started so that I could be more prepared. Creating this helped give me exposure to these important aspects of coding.
